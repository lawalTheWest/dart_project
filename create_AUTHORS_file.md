Certainly! Here's an example of how you can achieve this using shell commands, specifically using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and `jq` for JSON processing:

1. **Install the GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Follow the installation instructions for `gh` available at https://cli.github.com/.

2. **Authenticate with GitHub**: Run the following command and follow the prompts to authenticate with your GitHub account:
```shell
gh auth login
```

3. **Clone the repository**: Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository you want to collect contributor information from:
```shell
git clone <repository_url>
```

4. **Fetch contributor information**: Run the following command to fetch the contributor information:
```shell
gh api -X GET "/repos/:owner/:repo/contributors" | jq '.[] | {name, email}'
```
Replace `:owner` with the repository owner and `:repo` with the repository name.

5. **Extract names and email addresses**: The `jq` command filters the JSON response and extracts the `name` and `email` fields for each contributor.

6. **Collate the data**: You can redirect the output of the previous command to a file for storage. For example:
```shell
gh api -X GET "/repos/:owner/:repo/contributors" | jq '.[] | {name, email}' > contributors.json
```
This saves the contributor information to a file named `contributors.json` in the current directory.

Remember to replace `:owner` with the repository owner and `:repo` with the repository name in both API requests.

By running these commands, you'll fetch the contributors' names and email addresses and store them in a JSON file. You can modify the `jq` filter to extract any other relevant information from the response if needed.
